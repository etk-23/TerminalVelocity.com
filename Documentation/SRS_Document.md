  - Basic User Authentication: The authentication system is required to be simple and must rely on Firebase's built-in authentication mechanisms. Developers will have limited flexibility to customize or extend authentication features beyond what Firebase offers out-of-the-box.
  - Limited Database Structure: The database should be designed for lightweight, minimal storage and querying. Developers will need to optimize data models for basic tracking of user progress, and badges. Complex relational database queries or large data structures may not be feasible.
  - No Real-Time Collaboration:The system does not support features that enable real-time collaboration or multiplayer functionality due to backend and frontend limitations. User interactions are isolated, and any need for simultaneous interaction between users must be avoided.
  - Cross-Browser Compatibility: The game must be designed for compatibility with modern web browsers, but the scope is limited to basic HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Advanced browser-specific features should be avoided to maintain simplicity and cross-browser consistency.
  - Basic Level Security Practices: The application must adhere to basic security best practices, such as input validation, data encryption, and secure token storage for Firebase authentication. However, there will be no complex security features like multi-factor authentication, user role management.

#### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
  - Assumptions:
      - Availability of Firebase Services: It is assumed that Firebase services (Authentication and Database) will remain available and accessible for the project. Any changes or outages in Firebase's offerings, pricing models, or availability could affect the project's implementation.
      - Internet Access for Users: The game assumes users will have consistent internet access. If there are scenarios where users have intermittent or no internet, the game’s functionality (especially involving authentication or game progress) could be limited.
      - Browser Compatibility: It is assumed that users will use modern web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari), and that all browser updates and standards will align with the features implemented in the project. Issues may arise if users are using outdated browsers or browsers with incomplete support for HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
      - No Complex Infrastructure: The project assumes that there will be no requirement for a complex server infrastructure (e.g., load balancing, multiple servers). If the system scales beyond a basic number of users, there could be performance bottlenecks.

  - Dependencies: 
      - Firebase: The project is dependent on Firebase for user authentication and database services. Any updates or service disruptions in Firebase could directly affect the project’s backend functionality.
      - Frontend Libraries and Frameworks: The game depends on basic frontend technologies (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript). Changes in these libraries’ versions or deprecated features could affect the development process.
      - User’s Device Performance: The performance of the game depends on the hardware and browser capabilities of users’ devices. If users are on lower-end devices, there could be limitations in rendering the UI or executing the simulated terminal environment.
      - Security Compliance: If the project needs to comply with specific security standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for data storage or user authentication, this could introduce additional requirements for the backend and database structure, affecting the scope and design of the project.
      - Browser Updates: Assumption is made that major browser updates will not introduce breaking changes to the core web technologies used in the project. If browsers make changes that deprecate essential features, the system may need rework or fixes.

### External Interface Requirements
#### User Interfaces
The UI will adhere to modern GUI standards, ensuring consistency with clear navigation, labeled menus, and standard action buttons (e.g., "Submit," "Cancel"). Error messages will follow a standardized format with error codes and corrective actions. A responsive design will ensure compatibility across desktop, laptop, and tablet devices, adjusting to different screen sizes and input methods. UI specifications, including layout and components, will be documented separately for detailed design.
#### Hardware Interfaces
The application will support devices with modern web browsers (desktop, laptop, tablet) using standard input methods such as keyboard, mouse, or touch. It will employ a responsive web design that adapts to different screen sizes, resolutions, and input methods. No specialized hardware is required, and communication will occur via standard web protocols (HTTPS) for secure data transfer between the client and server.
#### Software Interfaces
This web application is locally hosted and does not rely on third-party libraries, external databases, or secure communication protocols since no internet connection or remote services are involved. As such, the application operates in a contained environment on a local machine. The key software components include the frontend, which is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend, where the server-side logic is implemented using JavaScript to handle user input and execute necessary operations. Firebase is used solely for storing user progress, and data is handled locally without any external API calls. Since there is no data sharing or communication with other software components, there are no specific protocols or data formats that need to be adhered to. The application does not rely on secure communication (such as HTTPS) as it operates entirely within the local environment. Additionally, since no external dependencies are involved, there are no complex data exchange protocols or services to define.
#### Communications Interfaces
The application will use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) for secure client-server communication, with data transmitted using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). JSON will be used for data exchange between the frontend and backend. All communication will follow industry-standard protocols for security and efficiency.
